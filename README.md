# Portobello-Tech-Employee-Attrition-Prediction
A machine learning project that predicts employee attrition using HR analytics data.
Built an end-to-end pipeline for data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model training to identify key drivers of employee turnover.
Features
Data Analysis & Visualization:
Cleaned and processed HR dataset (missing values, encoding categorical features).
Explored feature correlations to uncover patterns related to attrition.
Machine Learning Models:
Implemented and compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting classifiers.
Evaluated models with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Results:
Best-performing model: Random Forest with ~73% accuracy.
Identified top features influencing attrition, such as satisfaction level, number of projects, and average monthly hours.
Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Jupyter Notebook
Future Improvements
Implement hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV for improved performance.
Deploy model as an API endpoint using Flask or AWS SageMaker.
